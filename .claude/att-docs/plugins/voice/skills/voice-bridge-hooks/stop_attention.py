"""Says what a session that just stopped needs from the user, if anything.

usage: stop_attention.py --config <extension.json> < <Stop hook payload>

Prints the words speak-attention.sh speaks after "<title> session" and exits 0, or prints
nothing and exits 3 when the stop needs no announcement. Any other exit is a failure, and the
caller still speaks. It reads the turn that just ended, from the last row that started one: a
user prompt, or an automated event such as a task notification, a pull request monitor's
report, or another session's message.

- The turn added the review label the extension file names. The label's own announcement
  names the pull request, so the stop stays quiet.
- The turn leaves the user something to answer: the wrap-up box carries a question, or the
  reply's last line ends in a question mark. Prints "is waiting for you".
- The user started the turn, or sent a message during it, and nothing is left to answer.
  Prints "finished", since the user asked for the work and may have stepped away.
- An automated event started the turn and nothing is left to answer. Quiet: the session
  reported on its own work. An announcement an earlier stop held back for background work is
  owed by speak-attention.sh, not read from here.
