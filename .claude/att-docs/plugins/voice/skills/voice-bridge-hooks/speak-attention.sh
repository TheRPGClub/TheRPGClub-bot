#                                  needs from the user, or an earlier stop held

#   PreToolUse  AskUserQuestion    the session is about to ask a question
#   PostToolUse Bash               a pull request got the review label
# The extension file names the review label (reviewLabel), the words spoken once it
# lands (reviewAnnouncement), and the words the voice would misread (spokenTerms). A
# missing --config exits 64.
# With speech mode on, the reply is read aloud instead, and the other announcements
# stay quiet. It starts off. Each text block is read as it lands: a PreToolUse for any
# tool reads what was written ahead of that call, and the Stop reads the rest. An
# AskUserQuestion call's question and options are read with the text ahead of it, and
# a wrap-up question with its buttons after the closing reply.
# speechctl and the speech widget turn it on and off; no command a session runs does.
# Every implementation is a managed session: its .managed marker puts it in the session
# management widget, which reads it through speechctl sessions. The implement skill sets
# the marker, typed (UserPromptSubmit) or called through the Skill tool (PostToolUse
# Skill), and leaves speech mode as it was.
# Outside speech mode, a session a phone follows through the voice bridge still sends its
# text to the voice feed ahead of each tool call, and reads none of it aloud.
# A managed session (its .managed marker) also writes every block to <id>.feed, whatever
# its speech setting, so the session management widget can list its replies without
# anything being read aloud.
# Each session's speech is On (its .replies marker), Alerts only (the default: neither
# marker) or Off (its .muted marker, which silences the announcements too). speechctl sets
# it, and reads and drives playback through the files this script keeps in the speak-attention
# folder: now.json while a clip plays, paused while speech is held, skip and requeue for a
# clip speechctl is ending, and settings.json for the voice, volume and pace. A session may
# also have a voice of its own in <id>.voice, which the speech widget writes.
# Anything else exits quietly, as does a machine without jq or python3, or with
# neither Piper nor spd-say to speak.
# The label case asks ready_line.py, which holds the same rules for the ready signal, so
# the two never disagree on what a label add is.
