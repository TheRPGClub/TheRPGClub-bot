"""Hands a stopped session's reply to the voice bridge when the bridge is waiting on it.

usage: voice_bridge_reply.py < <Stop hook payload>
       voice_bridge_reply.py push < <spoken text>
       voice_bridge_reply.py opened < <PostToolUse Bash hook payload>
       voice_bridge_reply.py milestone < <Stop hook payload>
       voice_bridge_reply.py attention < <PermissionRequest, PreToolUse, PostToolUse or
                                          UserPromptSubmit hook payload>
       voice_bridge_reply.py answer < <PermissionRequest hook payload>
       voice_bridge_reply.py ready < <Stop hook payload>

Each form takes `--config <extension.json>` ahead of its name, for the ready line and the
review label it reads through ready_line.py, and a missing one exits 64.

voice-bridge.mjs posts a spoken request into a session's inbox socket and leaves a marker named
for that socket in $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/voice-bridge/pending. When this session stops and its own
socket (CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET) has a marker, the turn's last_assistant_message is written
to voice-bridge/replies/<socket name>.json for the bridge's read_reply tool. While the phone
follows the session (a recent voice-bridge/follow/<socket name> marker), every reply is also
added to voice-bridge/feed/<socket name>.json for next_update.

In speech mode (a speak-attention/<session id>.replies marker) speak-attention.sh pushes
the blocks it reads aloud to the feed with the push form, as written and follow or not, so
the phone hears every reply, question and mid-turn note the speaker does. The Stop payload
then leaves the feed to those pushes and only answers a pending request. Outside speech mode,
speak-attention.sh pushes a followed session's mid-turn text the same way, ahead of each tool
call. The Stop payload still adds the final reply.

The attention form keeps voice-bridge/attention/<socket name>.json, which says what the
session waits on the user for, for the bridge's list_sessions and needs_attention tools. A
PermissionRequest writes it as a permission prompt for the named tool, and while a phone
follows the session it also adds a note to the feed, since a prompt never reaches the
transcript text that speak-attention.sh pushes. An AskUserQuestion call writes it as a
question. A call's PostToolUse clears that call's mark and the last stop's question, since
both were answered by then, and leaves a parallel call's prompt marked. A prompt the user
denies has no PostToolUse; the next PermissionRequest or PostToolUse finds its refusal in the
transcript and drops it. A UserPromptSubmit clears every mark. The Stop payload writes it as
a question when the turn leaves the user one, by stop_attention.py's test, and clears it
otherwise. The attention form prints nothing, so it never answers a prompt.

The answer form is the only one that answers a prompt, and it answers only the one
PermissionRequest it runs for, with what the user said in a voice chat. It writes the prompt
to voice-bridge/prompts/<socket name>/<id>.json under an id made for that request, and waits
up to ANSWER_WAIT_SECONDS for the bridge's answer_prompt tool to write
voice-bridge/answers/<socket name>/<id>.json, which the bridge does only after reading the
prompt back and hearing a yes. An answer under the request's id becomes the hook's decision:
allow, deny, or for an AskUserQuestion call allow with the answers, and the hook leaves
answers/<socket name>/<id>.took beside it before removing it, so the bridge knows the
request was still waiting when the answer landed. It never
sends permission updates, so nothing is allowed past this one call. The app's dialog stays
open meanwhile, and whichever answers first decides; once the app has, the wait ends. A
tool that changes the session's mode, a path in a .claude folder, a shell command that names
one or a settings.json file, and input too long to read back in full are left to the app.

A follow in milestones mode (a voice-bridge/follow/<socket name>.mode file) hears only the
feed entries marked as milestones. The prompt note carries milestone: true in either mode.
The rest are kind milestone entries, which only milestones mode hears and which are written
only while a follow is in that mode: an AskUserQuestion call's questions; the opened form's
entry after a `gh pr create` that printed a new pull request's URL; and the milestone form's
copy of a Stop's reply, run as an async Stop hook since its checks read the whole transcript.
That copy is added when the reply carries the ready line, leaves the user
a question, or ends the turn with no background work due to wake the session, by
background_pending.py's test.

A Stop whose reply carries the ready line, the extension file's readyLine, also
starts the ready form in a process of its own, follow or not. It runs the milestone form's
ready test, and for each pull request the line names writes
voice-bridge/ready/<socket name>-<N>.json, which the bridge announces once per pull request
and head.

Anything else, a session with no socket, no marker or no reply text, exits quietly. With its
config read it always exits 0, so a failure here never holds a session's stop.
